Book Suggestion - Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James

*ML is a method of Data Analysis that automates analytical model building

used for- fraud detection, credt score etc...

data Aauisition -- data cleaning -- Model Traning & building-- Model Testing--Model Deployment
                                 -- Test Data---
                                 
                                 
Spark MLlib
1) Supervised Learning - labeled examples(desired output is known)
uses methods like classification, regression, prediction and gradient boosting, SL uses patterns to predict values if the label on additional unlabeled data
used in apps where historical data predicts likely future events
2) unsupervised learning - used against data that has no historical labels. goal is to explore the data and fins some structure
popular techniques incluse slef-organizing maps, nearest-neighbour mapping, k-means clustering and singular value decomposition.
difficult to evaluate results of this model.

RDD - older spark syntax
Dataframe - new spark syntax

quirks of using MLlib - has one or two columns
Supervised - Feautures, Labels
Unsupervised - Features

Linear Regression:
ex: A father's son's height tends to regress(or drift towards) the mean(avg) height
least square method -??
